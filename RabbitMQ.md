# Install the amqplib package, which is a popular library for interacting with RabbitMQ in Node.js. You can install it by running npm install amqplib.

# Next, you can set up a publisher and a consumer. The publisher will send messages to RabbitMQ, and the consumer will receive those messages and perform the notification logic.

# Here's an example of a publisher:

const amqp = require('amqplib');

async function publishNotification(notification) {
--const connection = await amqp.connect('amqp://localhost');
--const channel = await connection.createChannel();
--const queue = 'notifications';

--await channel.assertQueue(queue);
--await channel.sendToQueue(queue, Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(notification)));

--console.log(`Sent notification: ${JSON.stringify(notification)}`);

--await channel.close();
--await connection.close();
}

# In this example, we're connecting to a local instance of RabbitMQ, creating a channel, and asserting the existence of a queue called "notifications". We then send a message to that queue containing the notification data. Finally, we close the channel and connection.

# And here's an example of a consumer:

const amqp = require('amqplib');

async function consumeNotifications() {
--const connection = await amqp.connect('amqp://localhost');
--const channel = await connection.createChannel();
--const queue = 'notifications';

--await channel.assertQueue(queue);
--await channel.consume(queue, (message) => {
----const notification = JSON.parse(message.content.toString());
----console.log(`Received notification: ${JSON.stringify(notification)}`);
----// Perform notification logic here
----channel.ack(message);
});

console.log('Waiting for notifications...');
}

consumeNotifications();

# In this example, we're also connecting to a local instance of RabbitMQ, creating a channel, and asserting the existence of a queue called "notifications". We then consume messages from that queue, parse the notification data, and perform the notification logic (which you would need to implement yourself). Finally, we acknowledge the message so that RabbitMQ knows it has been successfully processed.

# By using RabbitMQ in this way, you can decouple the notification logic from the application flow. The application simply publishes a notification to RabbitMQ, and the consumer picks up that notification and performs the necessary logic. This can make your application more resilient and easier to maintain, since you can modify the notification logic without having to change the application itself.
