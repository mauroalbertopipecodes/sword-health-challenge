# This is a sample Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml configuration files for building and deploying a Node.js application, along with a MySQL database and a PHPMyAdmin interface to interact with it.

# The Dockerfile contains instructions on how to build a Docker image for the Node.js application. The content of the file is as follows:

FROM node:14-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package\*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]

# The first line specifies the base image to use, which is node:14-alpine. This image contains Node.js and NPM pre-installed, and is based on the Alpine Linux distribution, which is a lightweight Linux distribution.

# The next line sets the working directory inside the Docker container to /app.

# The COPY commands copy the package\*.json files and the rest of the application code into the container's working directory.

# The RUN command runs npm install inside the container, which installs the dependencies required by the application.

# The EXPOSE command exposes port 3000, which is the port that the application listens on.

# The CMD command specifies the command to run when the container starts. In this case, it runs npm run dev, which starts the application in development mode.

# The docker-compose.yml file contains the configuration for running the Node.js application, MySQL database, and PHPMyAdmin interface using Docker Compose. The content of the file is as follows:

version: '3.2'

# The version field specifies the version of Docker Compose syntax to use.

# The services section defines the three services that will be deployed: db, phpmyadmin, and app.

# The db service uses the mysql:latest image, sets some environment variables for the database, and maps port 3306 to the host machine.

# The phpmyadmin service uses the phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin:latest image, sets the necessary environment variables to connect to the db service, and maps port 8080 to the host machine.

# The app service builds the Docker image defined in the Dockerfile, maps port 3000 to the host machine, and sets some environment variables needed for the application to connect to the db service. The depends_on option specifies that the db service must be started before the app service.

# The volumes section defines two volumes: db_data and node_modules. The db_data volume is used to persist the MySQL data, and the node_modules volume is used to cache the node_modules directory so that it doesn't need to be installed every time the container starts.

# When the docker-compose up command is run, Docker Compose reads the docker-compose.yml file, starts the necessary containers, and connects them to the defined networks.
