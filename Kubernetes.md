# 1- Create a Deployment object file: A Deployment object manages a replicated application, which means it creates and manages a set of replicas of your application. To create a Deployment object file, you can use the following YAML file as an example:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
--name: <DEPLOYMENT_NAME>
spec:
--replicas: <NUMBER_OF_REPLICAS>
--selector:
----matchLabels:
------app: <APP_NAME>
--template:
----metadata:
------labels:
--------app: <APP_NAME>
----spec:
------containers:
--------name: <CONTAINER_NAME>
--------image: <DOCKER_IMAGE>
--------ports:
----------containerPort: <PORT>

# In this file, you will need to replace the placeholders enclosed in angle brackets (< >) with your specific values. For example, replace <DEPLOYMENT_NAME> with the name you want to give your Deployment, <NUMBER_OF_REPLICAS> with the number of replicas you want to create, <APP_NAME> with a name for your application, <CONTAINER_NAME> with a name for your container, <DOCKER_IMAGE> with the name of your Docker image (including the repository and tag), and <PORT> with the port your Node.js application listens on.

# 2- Create a Service object file: A Service object exposes your application to the network, which means it makes it accessible to other pods and services. To create a Service object file, you can use the following YAML file as an example:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
--name: <SERVICE_NAME>
spec:
--selector:
----app: <APP_NAME>
--ports:
----name: http
----port: <PORT>
----targetPort: <PORT>
--type: ClusterIP

# In this file, you will need to replace the placeholders enclosed in angle brackets (< >) with your specific values. For example, replace <SERVICE_NAME> with the name you want to give your Service, <APP_NAME> with the name you used for your app label in the Deployment object file, and <PORT> with the same port you used in the Deployment object file.

# 3- Apply the object files: Once you have created the Deployment and Service object files, you can apply them to your Kubernetes cluster using the kubectl apply command. For example, if your object files are named deployment.yaml and service.yaml, you can apply them with the following commands:

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml

# After applying these object files, Kubernetes will create a set of replicas of your Node.js application and expose it to the network through a Service object. You can verify that your application is running by checking the logs of one of the pods created by the Deployment:

kubectl logs <POD_NAME>

# You can also access your application by using the IP address of the Service and the port you specified in the Service object file. For example, if the IP address of the Service is 10.0.0.1 and the port is 8080, you can access your application by visiting http://10.0.0.1:8080 in a web browser.
